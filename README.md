# story

This repo is a [Hugo theme](https://gohugo.io) targeted to technical writers and
speakers: people such as software engineers and open source developers, who want a
website that showcases their technical work, such as blogging about software
engineering. It's a great way to share your writing and speaking with the world.

It has a lot of features that might appeal to people who invest effort in their websites and blogs:

- It's designed for long-form content, including blogs and single pages.
- It's simple and clean, but has features to add a little more visual appeal, such as header images to add mood/illustration to content.
- It has native support for [RemarkJS slides](https://remarkjs.com/) to build presentations in Markdown. It not only makes RemarkJS easy, but it adds other features to RemarkJS such as QR code support for easy distribution of slides (no more "can you mail me your slides"), a RemarkJS theme that adds most-needed features like two-column layouts, and content types needed to integrate slideshows into your site nicely: each presentation can have a full-featured "talks" companion page, as well as the slides themselves.
- It supports a number of features out-of-the-box, such as LaTeX math typesetting with [KaTeX](https://github.com/Khan/KaTeX), and a built-in search page with [LunrJS](https://github.com/olivernn/lunr.js).
- It's "social native" with all the tags and metadata to make it highly shareable on social media sites, as well as being "tech native" with RSS feeds and the like.
- It's optimized for print output, so articles will print beautifully to paper or PDF while also looking great on screen.
- It's mobile-first and responsive, designed for readability and clarity on any screen size or resolution from a smartphone to a large display, whether high-resolution ("Retina") or low-resolution.

Although it's pretty rich and robust, it's also work in progress, and I would appreciate any pull requests. See the issues for the ideas I have planned for it.
